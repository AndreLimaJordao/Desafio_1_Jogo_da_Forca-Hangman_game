# Hangman Program:
The code is a challenge of the C++ programming course to improve my skills in the language. 
It consists of the hangman game, where the word is manipulated within the code and it is configured for that word, needing only to change 2 variables: the word and the number of lives available.
The code was formulated in PT/BR, in the future I will make a version in English.
